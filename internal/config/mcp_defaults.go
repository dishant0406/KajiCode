// search and scraping work out of the box with no setup and no API key. They are
// seeded before user/project config is merged (see ResolveMCP), so a user can
// override any field — for example point firecrawl at a self-hosted instance, or
// add an API-key header to lift the free-tier limit — or disable it entirely with
// `kajicode mcp disable <name>` (which writes `"disabled": true`).
//
// Keyless Firecrawl routes requests through firecrawl.dev (1,000 free credits per
// month, no account). Self-host Firecrawl (AGPL-3.0) for unlimited and private
// use. KajiCode only calls it over the network, so Firecrawl's license never reaches
// into KajiCode's own code.

//
// Both conditions below must hold:
//   - !server.configured: the user's JSON never declared an object for this
//     server key at all (set by MCPServerConfig.UnmarshalJSON only when it
//     actually ran for this key). Any explicit action — including a
//     disable/enable toggle like `kajicode mcp enable firecrawl` that leaves the
//     resolved value unchanged — sets configured, so it always counts as
//     user-configured, even though the value comparison below could not tell
//     the difference on its own.
//   - reflect.DeepEqual(def, server): the value still matches the default.
//     This is the fallback for callers that construct MCPServerConfig
//     directly rather than through the JSON/merge pipeline (server.configured
//     is then always false) — without it, any hand-built config with
//     different field values would be misreported as unconfigured.
//
// Callers use this to tell "server we turned on for the user" apart from
// "server the user configured themselves," e.g. to avoid warning loudly when
// an out-of-the-box default that was never given credentials fails to connect.
