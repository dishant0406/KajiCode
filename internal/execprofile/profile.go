// Package execprofile defines named execution profiles: bundles of loop-posture
// knobs (turn budget, reasoning effort, self-correction, escalation triggers)
// that tune how hard the agent loop tries, independent of which model runs.
// Profiles COMPOSE with --mode: a mode answers "what runs" (model, tools),
// a profile answers "how hard the loop tries". Selection precedence is
// explicit flag > --mode > profile, enforced by the callers applying profiles
// last with the same fill-only-if-unset rule modes use.
//
// The catalog is deliberately tiny and value-stable: balanced is the empty
// profile (selecting it leaves the run's options, budget, and loop behavior
// identical to an unflagged run — asserted by test; only the opt-in trace and
// bench artifacts record the selected profile name, by design, so captures are
// self-describing), fast trades turn budget and effort for latency with a
// one-shot escalation back to the displaced posture as the safety net, and
// thorough raises the budget and arms full self-correction.
