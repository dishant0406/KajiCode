# npm packaging

How `@dishant0406/kajicode` is put together on npm, why it is shaped this way, and the
rules the release pipeline must follow. Read this before touching
`package.json`, `bin/kajicode.js`, `scripts/postinstall.mjs`,
`scripts/npm/build-platform-packages.mjs`, or the npm-publish steps of
`publish-npm.yml`.

## Goals

A `npm install -g @dishant0406/kajicode` must be **silent and self-contained**:

- No `EBADENGINE` warnings — ours or from any package in the dependency tree.
- No install scripts anywhere in the tree, so npm's `allow-scripts` gating,
  Bun's blocked-by-default lifecycle scripts, and pnpm's strict mode all
  install KajiCode without prompts, trust ceremonies, or broken binaries.
- No network fetches outside the npm registry at install time. GitHub being
  down or rate-limited must not break `npm install`.
- Browser control (`agent-browser`) and terminal control (`tuistory`) work out
  of the box.

## Architecture

The model is the one used by Codex, esbuild, and Biome: a tiny wrapper package
plus per-platform payloads carrying the native binaries.

```
@dishant0406/kajicode                    <- wrapper: bin/kajicode.js + optionalDependencies
├─ @dishant0406/kajicode-darwin-arm64 -> npm:@dishant0406/kajicode@{version}-darwin-arm64
├─ @dishant0406/kajicode-darwin-x64   -> npm:@dishant0406/kajicode@{version}-darwin-x64
├─ @dishant0406/kajicode-linux-arm64  -> npm:@dishant0406/kajicode@{version}-linux-arm64
├─ @dishant0406/kajicode-linux-x64    -> npm:@dishant0406/kajicode@{version}-linux-x64
└─ @dishant0406/kajicode-win32-x64    -> npm:@dishant0406/kajicode@{version}-win32-x64
```

- The platform "packages" are **versions of the same `@dishant0406/kajicode` package**,
  published at suffixed versions (`0.4.0-linux-x64`) and referenced through
  `npm:` aliases in `optionalDependencies`. One package name means one npm
  publish credential — no new npm packages or credentials per platform.
  The alias suffixes use Node's `process.platform`/`process.arch` names so
  `bin/kajicode.js` can derive its platform package directly.
- Each platform version sets `os` and `cpu`, so npm installs exactly one of
  them and skips the rest.
- A platform payload is assembled from the platform's release archive by
  `scripts/npm/build-platform-packages.mjs` and contains the `kajicode` binary,
  the platform's sandbox helpers, and the vendored `helpers/` tree (see
  below). It has no `bin`, no scripts, and no dependencies — it is inert on
  its own; the wrapper execs the binary out of it.
- The published wrapper has **no scripts and no dependencies** — the
  assembly script strips both from the repo `package.json` and injects the
  exact-version `optionalDependencies`. (The repo `package.json` keeps
  `agent-browser`/`tuistory` in `dependencies` purely as the version pins for
  the vendored helpers tree; they are never installed by consumers.)
- There is **no windows-arm64 build** (matches the release matrix); Windows on
  ARM runs the x64 build under emulation via the first-run fallback.

### Binary resolution in `bin/kajicode.js`

1. Resolve `@dishant0406/kajicode-<platform>-<arch>` and exec the `kajicode` binary from
   it. This wins over any previously downloaded copy — the platform version is
   pinned to the wrapper release.
2. Fall back to a binary previously downloaded next to the wrapper.
3. If neither exists (`--omit=optional`, package managers that skip optional
   dependencies), run the **fallback downloader**: `scripts/postinstall.mjs`,
   the exact logic that used to run as a postinstall hook (HTTPS-only, SHA-256
   verified against the release's own checksum file, no zip-slip), invoked by
   the wrapper itself. Failures are deliberately not cached — the fetch
   retries on every run until a binary is in place, so a transient network
   error self-heals. Platforms with no release asset (anything outside the
   matrix above, including windows-arm64) skip the attempt entirely rather
   than probing the network each run.
4. If the download is impossible too, print build-from-source guidance.

There is deliberately **no `scripts.postinstall`** in any published
`package.json`. The downloader exists only as a first-run fallback.

### Vendored helpers (`helpers/`)

`agent-browser` (Apache-2.0, vercel-labs/agent-browser) and `tuistory` are
**vendored binaries/packages inside the platform payload**, not npm
dependencies of the wrapper:

- As a dependency, agent-browser's `engines: { node: ">=24", pnpm: ">=11" }`
  and postinstall script produce `EBADENGINE` and `allow-scripts` warnings for
  every installer. As a vendored tree it produces none, because npm never
  resolves it.
- `kajicode-release package` already stages the helpers tree into every release
  archive (`stageLocalControlHelpers` runs `npm ci` from the repo's
  `package.json` pins + lockfile on the native builder). The assembly script
  reuses that staged tree, so npm installs and `install.sh` installs get
  identical helpers.
- The Go binary resolves helpers from `<binary dir>/helpers/node_modules/.bin`
  on its own (`internal/localcontrol/browser.go`, `adjacentHelper`) — no
  wrapper involvement, no configuration.
- **Symlink materialization:** `npm pack` silently drops symlinks, and npm's
  own `.bin` shims are symlinks on POSIX. The assembly script rewrites every
  `.bin` symlink into a relocatable `#!/bin/sh` exec shim and dereferences any
  other symlink, so the vendored tree survives publishing. (Verified
  empirically; nested `node_modules` under `helpers/` IS packed — only the
  package-root `node_modules` is always ignored.)
- **Binary pruning:** agent-browser ships one ~11 MB native binary per
  platform (7 total). The assembly script keeps only the payload's own
  platform binary (plus the musl variant on linux, which its launcher detects
  at runtime) — about 65 MB saved per platform package.

## Publishing rules (release pipeline)

These are the invariants `publish-npm.yml` must hold. Breaking the first
one is user-visible immediately.

1. **Platform versions must never become `latest`.** `0.4.0-linux-x64` is a
   semver *prerelease* of `0.4.0`; publishing it without an explicit
   non-`latest` dist-tag would clobber `latest` and users would install a
   platform payload as the CLI. The workflow publishes platform versions with
   `--tag platform` and asserts `latest` survived before the wrapper publish,
   then asserts `latest` equals the wrapper version after it. Both lookups
   tolerate a failed `npm view` (registry lag, or no `latest` tag yet on a
   bootstrap publish) — a missing value must not abort the job between the
   platform and wrapper publishes, which would strand a half-published
   release.
2. **Platform versions publish before the wrapper.** The wrapper's
   `optionalDependencies` pin exact suffixed versions; publishing the wrapper
   first would create a window where installs resolve aliases that 404.
3. **Exact-version pinning.** The wrapper at `X.Y.Z` references platform
   versions `X.Y.Z-<platform>-<arch>` exactly — never ranges — so a wrapper
   and its binaries can never skew.
4. All publishes use the repository `NPM_TOKEN` secret through `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
   Because the platform payloads are versions of the same package, they reuse
   the single package-scoped publish credential. The workflow still requests
   `id-token: write` and publishes with `--provenance` so npm can attach
   GitHub Actions provenance when supported.

`kajicode update` keeps working unchanged: it detects an npm install by finding a
`package.json` named `@dishant0406/kajicode` next to the running binary — true inside
a platform payload too — and updates via `npm install -g @dishant0406/kajicode@latest`.

## Runbook: bumping the vendored helpers

The vendored helper versions are pinned by the repo `package.json`
`dependencies` + `package-lock.json`; the release build vendors exactly what
the lockfile resolves. No `^range` surprises ship: a release carries what its
lockfile pinned at build time.

- Routine bump: `npm install agent-browser@<version>` (or `tuistory@…`) in the
  repo to update pin + lockfile, verify the browser/terminal tools end-to-end,
  ship with the next release.
- Security response: if a vendored helper publishes a security fix, the bump
  is release-worthy on its own — cut a patch release of KajiCode carrying only the
  pin change.
- Attribution: agent-browser is Apache-2.0; its LICENSE ships inside the
  vendored package directory (`helpers/node_modules/agent-browser/`), which
  satisfies redistribution attribution.

## History / rationale

Until v0.3.x the npm package was a wrapper with a `postinstall` downloader and
`agent-browser`/`tuistory` as regular dependencies. That produced three
warnings on every install (`EBADENGINE` from agent-browser's `node >=24`
engines pin, and `allow-scripts` warnings for both postinstall scripts), broke
silently under Bun's default script blocking, and coupled `npm install` to
GitHub Releases availability. The platform-package model removes the warnings
structurally — there is nothing left in the tree for a package manager to warn
about — rather than asking users to approve or suppress them.
